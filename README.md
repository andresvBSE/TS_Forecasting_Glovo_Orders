# Forecasting Glovo's orders

According to Wikipedia: "Glovo is a Spanish quick-commerce start-up founded in Barcelona in 2015. It is an on-demand courier service that purchases, picks up, and delivers products ordered through its mobile app. It offers multiple services with food delivery being the most popular".

This repository shows an example of how to forecast hourly orders (food delivery services) for a full week, following the basis that each week the decision maker has to assign enough deliverers to fulfil the demand for orders.

Note: This is not the real data of Glovo, although it shares many of the properties of the real times series of the orders.
